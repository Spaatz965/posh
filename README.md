## my-powershell

Welcome to my personal PowerShell repository of scripts and snippets I've found useful.

**Disclaimer:** *I am not a developer, nor an expert with PowerShell. I'm learning more all the time*

## Influences

[Todd Klindt - @ToddKlindt](https://twitter.com/ToddKlindt "Todd's Twitter") is one of the SharePoint people I follow. A couple years ago, he made a comment along the lines of, "if you're not planning to learn PowerShell, you're planning to leave IT". I took that to heart and got started (slowly).

[Don Jones - @concentrateddon](https://twitter.com/concentrateddon "Don's Twitter") is an AWESOME PowerShell source. He influenced some of the ways I write scripts and snippets, and is the influencer for why I setup this repository.

[Jeff Hicks - @JeffHicks](https://twitter.com/JeffHicks "Jeff's Twitter") is also an AWESOME PowerShell source. He co-authored, with Don, the PowerShell in a Month of Lunch series of books.

[Shane Young - @ShanesCows](https://twitter.com/ShanesCows "Shane's Twitter") is another of the SharePoint people I follow. Todd and Shane do a lot of good community stuff.
